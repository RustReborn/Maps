# Maps
Maps for the RustReborn.gg Servers.

# Having automatic map download issues?
1. Head over to our [ManualDownload/](ManualDownload/) files and download the one which you are missing. 
2. Move the map file into your rust game directory "maps" folder.
3. Reconnect to the server and your issue should be fixed.

When looking for the correct map file to manually download you can ignore the numbers appended at the end of the file.
## Example
Say you are missing a map that starts with "RRBedwarsV5_019_Winter":
- Look into [ManualDownload/minigames/V5_019_Winter/](ManualDownload/minigames/V5_019_Winter/) and download all the files within
- If you only want the main map file (without Performance Mode) only download the [file](ManualDownload/minigames/RRBedwarsV5_019_Winter_1514672649.map) called "RRBedwarsV5_019_Winter_1514672649.map"
- Move the files to your rust client "maps" folder
- Done, reconnect!
